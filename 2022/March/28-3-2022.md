Today I have completed the English course and downloaded the certificate. I will post that on our Facebook group tomorrow in sha Allah. 

I have also discussed with Moaz vai and Zubair vai and gave some instructions. Zubair vai told me that the way we are discussing and giving the instructions is helping him to work effectively. I will notify you the progress step by step in sha Allah. 

Another thing that I want to share with you is that yesterday I bought a course from https://mentorianbd.com/ to see their internal structure and way of presenting the course. I would like to suggest you that we should take some other courses as well to analyze the dashboard and way of their presentation or system of the course. It will help us to build our system unique.
